# Ultraleap Lynx Hand Simulator 🖐️🧪

**Simulate Lynx-style hand tracking using Ultraleap inside Unity.**

This is a prototype Unity project that emulates Lynx XR hand tracking behavior using Ultraleap's hand tracking system. The goal is to create a simulated interaction pipeline for testing and development of gesture-based interfaces in standalone XR.

---

## 🚧 Project Status

> This repository is under active development and not yet production-ready. Expect changes, breakage, and experimental features.

---

## ✨ Features

* Simulated Lynx-style hand input using Ultraleap tracking
* Unity-based visual and interaction environment
* Raw hand tracking via LeapC or Unity Modules
* Foundation for XR interaction testing and gesture mapping

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Unity 2022.x or later**
* **Ultraleap Hand Tracking Software (Gemini v5.2+)**
* **Ultraleap camera hardware** (Leap Motion Controller or Stereo IR 170)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Suriya-Palaniswami/ultraleap-lynx-hand-simulator.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity Hub.
3. Import the Ultraleap Unity Modules (Hands Module, LeapC, etc.)
4. Plug in your Ultraleap device and start the Ultraleap tracking service.
5. Press play in the Unity Editor or build the app for your target platform.

---

## 🧭 Usage

* Run the Unity scene and use your hands in front of the Ultraleap camera.
* The project visualizes and interprets hand tracking as if on a Lynx-style device.
* Extend the simulator with custom gestures, physics interactions, or UX testing logic.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

* **LeapC Integration**: For raw frame-level access to hand tracking data.
* **Hands Module**: For prefab-based hand visualization and tracking in Unity.
* **Simulator Mode**: Optional toggles can simulate fake input or replay hand poses (coming soon).
